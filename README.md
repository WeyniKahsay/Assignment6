How did your final design compare to your initial idea? Did the balance and layout turn out as expected, or did you have to make adjustments along the way?
My final design did not look entirely like my first idea, but it's closer than the other ones I have done. The balance and the layout did turn out as expected. 
If you experimented with float and margin, please tell me about your experience.
I did experiment with float and margin. The way it turned out was surprising. It looks organized and creative. 
Additionally, reflect on any challenges you faced during this assignment and how you overcame them. Did you encounter any issues with balancing content or using CSS? How did you solve them?
I felt really challenged by the background coloring during this assignment.
